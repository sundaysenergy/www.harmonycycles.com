          <span class="blue">Do you sell bikes?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          While we do sell bikes, our focus is providing exceptional service, fast turnaround times, and the best possible prices. We are firmly rooted in the mission of making a quality cycling experience more accessible and friendly to all people. We are currently carrying a selection of city bikes from Bobbin, as well as a handful of used bikes.

          <span class="blue">Do you only work by appointment?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We prefer working by appointment. The best way to think about it is by comparing it to your local automobile repair shop. We are able to offer our uninterrupted attention and care, while also delivering repairs in a more predictable and timely manner. That said, our doors are generally open, and we'll be happy see you if you're in the neighborhood or need more urgent service.

          <span class="blue">How do I make an appointment?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make an appointment by <a href="#contact">filling out the form below</a>. For service not requiring unusual parts, you can pick up your bike the same day. If additional parts need to be ordered, delivery time will be 1-3 days.

          <span class="blue">How experienced are your mechanics?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our mechanics have between two and seven years of professional experience, with many more hours logged working on their own bikes. Since our business model prioritizes high quality, predictably delivered service, we can afford to work with the best people in the best environment. There's no need to worry about the rush of spring delivering your bike into the hands of an inexperienced mechanic, or having to wait for weeks to get premium service.

        <p>
          <span class="blue">How much do you charge?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to keep the pricing structure very simple. Our most popular option is the standard tuneup. While we only charge $49 for this service, it will exceed the standards of the $75 tuneups you will find at other shops. The service includes shifting and brake adjustments, wheel truing, basic cleaning and lubrication, tire inflation, and most other things you will need to have a properly functioning bicycle. Our deluxe tuneup is $99 and includes additional cleaning and new cables and housing. All other labor is billed at $0.75/minute.
